{"name":"MLitB","tagline":"Machine Learning in the Browser","body":"### What is MLitB?\r\nMachine Learning in the Browser (MLitB) is an ambitious software development project whose aim is to bring ML, in all its facets, to an audience that includes both the general public and the research community.  \r\n\r\n#### Why Machine Learning in the Browser?\r\nThe ubiquity of the browser as a computational engine makes it an ideal platform for the development of massively distributed and collaborative machine learning.  \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, we have written a lightweight software library that runs in native browsers, which is capable of performing massively distributed machine learning on heterogeneous devices (desktops, laptops, smart phones and tablets), embedding ML models into the devices for both prediction and collaborative learning initiatives,  be shared as an encapsulated object (a {\\em research closure}) containing configurations, code, and parameters.\r\n\r\nImplications of this software paradigm include truly collaborative machine learning, open to the public, real privacy preserving computation, field experiments, green computing, and more.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nRequirements: `node.js`, `redis-server`.\r\n\r\nTo install, clone the repository.  \r\n\r\nIn a terminal, start redis\r\n```\r\n$ redis-server &\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn another terminal, start the application:\r\n```\r\n$ node app.js -h localhost\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn another terminal, start the master node:\r\n```\r\n$ node master.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow open a tab in your browser to `local_host:8000`\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMLitB is a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Amsterdam with support from Amsterdam Data Science.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
