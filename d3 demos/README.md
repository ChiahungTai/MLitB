The neural network visualisations from ConvNetJS' demo pages (http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) rewritten in D3.

Usage: include the visualisation's files and call the function's update() function

to use D3 for the visualisations, so that these may be easily re-used in other code. Focus on the neural network visualisations.
