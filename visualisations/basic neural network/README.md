Visualisation of structure of a basic (standard/non-convolutional) neural network. Shows how the weights and activations change over time for the last example the user added. Basis of a framework for more complex visualisations of network structure.

Adding visualisation to network: 
* Include files starting with d3
* Add a div with id 'basicnet'
* Call updateBNet() and allow access to the network named 'net'. Also expects the points[] array as used by the decision boundary visualisation.
