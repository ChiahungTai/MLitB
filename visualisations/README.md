There's a html file for navigating to one of the demos that have a working version.

The neural network visualisations from ConvNetJS' demo pages (http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) rewritten in D3 as well as new visualisations for the same library.

General usage of the visualisations consists of including some files and calling an updateVisualisation(data) function with some specified data which will make the visualisation up to date. In case of possible user input another function may have to be specified addressing how the underlying network deals with that input.
