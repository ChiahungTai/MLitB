Parallel SGD in the browser
===========================

Implementation from http://www.searsmerritt.com/blog/2013/7/parallel-stochastic-gradient-descent-for-logistic-regression-in-python

Changed from python -> JS.

To run app, CD to directory and:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then point your web browser to http://localhost:8000

Inserting parameters unsuitable for your computer might crash or hang the web browser.

There is no master server. Everything happens in the browser. No support for streaming data.

Dependencies
------------
- JQuery: https://github.com/jquery/jquery
- Sylvester: https://github.com/jcoglan/sylvester
- Web browsers with Web Worker support: http://caniuse.com/webworkers

Sample data can be generated by sampledata.py.
The index.html requires:
  - x.js
  - y.js

Both are already in the repository.

Obtain new x and y by modifying the y.toList to x.toList and vice versa.
Then:
```
python sampledata.py | python -mjson.tool > y.json
```
or for x:
```
python sampledata.py | python -mjson.tool > x.json
```
